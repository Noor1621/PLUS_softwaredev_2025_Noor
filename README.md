Hello, this is my assignment for the task: 

Task:
Go through the process of re-creating environments:
Acquire You can fork the repo or download both .yml files individually.
Recreate both environments with conda (or try to do so). You can use the command line or the navigator (see tutorial document as PDF)
Document the process of recreating the environments in the README.md file associated with your GitHub repository for this course. Please share screenshots and descriptions of error messages and things that worked out.

Steps:
1. First, I downloaded the Code from the given repo.
3. Recreated environments using Anaconda prompt.
   conda env create -f environment1.yml
   conda env create -f environment2.yml

* Did not encounter any errors, all the  packages were already installed:)
