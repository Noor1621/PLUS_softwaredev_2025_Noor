Assignment A4 Summary
This assignment demonstrates basic geospatial visualization techniques using Python, with a focus on modular programming and clean documentation practices.

üîß Project Structure
geospatial_utils.py: A custom Python module containing reusable geospatial plotting functions using matplotlib, geopandas, and shapely.

A4_notebook.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that imports functions from the above module and demonstrates three geospatial visualization examples.

environment.yml: A Conda environment file to document the dependencies used in this project.

üìå Objectives
Apply clean code and documentation principles (PEP 257) in a Python script.

Use matplotlib to visualize geospatial data.

Import and use external .py functions within a notebook.

Track and commit the work in a structured GitHub repository.

üó∫Ô∏è Visualization Examples
Coordinate Plot
Visualizes a list of geographic coordinate points on a simple scatter plot.

Simple Polygon Plot
Plots a basic polygon (e.g., representing a region) defined by geographic points.

Mock Population Choropleth
Simulates a population choropleth map using dummy polygons and randomly generated population values.

üîç Note: The population choropleth example uses mock data for demonstration purposes only. No real-world population datasets are included in this assignment.

‚úÖ Skills Applied
Modular Python scripting

Geospatial data visualization

Jupyter Notebook documentation

Git and GitHub version control
